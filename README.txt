Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was a project that I undertook as part of my International Baccalaureate (IB) 
Computer Science Standard Level class for my IB Diploma. Thorough documentation for
the project was required. 

I especially encourage looking at the Crierion B - Design & Criterion C - Development,
to understand the thinking behind my project. 

Go into the "Documentation" directory, and click on the "Cover Page.htm" file to 
access all of the documentation.
